# hackerman
The hackerman library is one I made for two reasons.

	1. Because I want to make, package, and publish my own library
	2. So I can use it in my penetration testing programs

So yeah

# License
It is licensed under the GNU GPL (more info in the "LICENSE" file). It is my first time adding a license so I don't really know if I did it right.
Basically, don't distribute closed-source versions, but feel free to do whatever else you want with it, it would be cool if you credited me, though.
